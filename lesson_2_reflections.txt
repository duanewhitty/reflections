What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git creates the structure of the repository.  It creates a place to track
the changes to your files

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is a place to setup how your changes will be committed.  It
offers a chance to group logical changes together before you commit them.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
By running git status you can see what files are in the staging area and by
running git diff without any arguments you can see the differences between
the files in your working directory and the files in the staging area.
