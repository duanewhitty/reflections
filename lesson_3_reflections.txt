When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
I would use a remote repository when I want to share my work with other people.
It is also a good way to backup the work I've done in case my local copy is
lost or damaged.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
There might be changes that I'm working on that could conflict with commits
in the repository if a merge was attempted.  I might not be ready to try to
resolve the conflict because my work might not be as far along as I want.
In many ways the same logic applies to pulls as pushes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
